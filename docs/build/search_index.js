And a corollary is that all of the derived properties will be thermodynamically consistent (up to the precision of the calculation). The details of the Gibbs function are available in the literature [4, 5].

However, to simplify routine use where the pressure effects can be ignored, the SSC enthalpy routine has an overload feature which calculates (and uses) the saturation pressure for cases where the user does not input a pressure value.
